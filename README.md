# Pokemon List
Welcome to my pokemon list app, where you can see a list of pokemon with their types and moves. You can also try to catch them and see how many you've caught.
* Click on 'My List' to display all the pokemon you've caught.
* Click on a pokemon name to see the pokemon detail page.
* In the pokemon detail, you can see their types and moves
* Click the 'try to catch me' button in the pokemon detail to catch them. If you succeed, the pokemon counter will increase. If you don't then they will get away.
